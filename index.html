        <h1>Why Recycle?</h1>
        <content>
          <p>Waste has a huge negative impact on the environment and recycling helps to reduce this impact. Waste:
            <li>contributes to global warming</li>
            <li>harms wild animals and the natural environment</li>
            <li>produces methane gas</li>
            <li>and much more</li></p>
          <p>In the US, Louisiana ranks:
            <li>47th, environmental quality</li>
            <li>48th, energy consumption</li>
            <li>50th, eco-friendly behavior</li>
          </p>

        <p><b>ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW</b><br><br>

          Lee Magnet High School (LMHS) is a public high school located in the East Baton Rouge Parish School System (EBRPSS). Originally Robert E. Lee High school, LMHS was reopened in 2011 and renamed to Lee Magnet High School; the campus was then rebuilt to make it more energy efficient and modernized. The new campus opened for the 2016-2017 school year and has many features designed to save energy, such as motion-activated lights that turn off after a certain time if they do not detect movement, motion-activated sinks and hand dryers, and a classroom system that consists of roaming teachers to optimize space usage and limit the number of classrooms that would need to be air-conditioned. Additionally, all students are issued laptops to reduce the amount of paper waste produced by the school.<br><br>

          With a focus on energy efficiency and reduction of waste on our campus, we feel that implementing a recycling program would align well with our school’s purpose. While our school may have reduced paper waste, there is still a substantial amount of paper and plastics found in trashcans around campus. Several individual classrooms have implemented recycling cans, but those teachers take on the responsibility of bringing the material home for proper disposal. While talking with those teachers, they informed us that throughout the year, their students have taken the role of recycling upon themselves – disposing of paper and plastics in the makeshift recycle bins. Similarly, several teachers have equipped their offices with recycle bins that they alternate taking home for disposal. We believe that given the proper receptacles and information on what can be recycled, our entire student body and staff would take ownership of the program. </p>

          <p><b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b><br><br>

          Despite the efforts to make LMHS more energy efficient, we lack a recycling program that could redirect the recyclable materials the student body and administration wastes to a recycling facility rather than letting it go to the trash. The LMHS Recycling Initiative intends to rectify this by setting up recycling bins around the campus, as well as establishing educational programs for the students and staff.<br><br>

          To accomplish this, we would like to provide large and small recycle bins across campus, as well as information banners and fliers. Our school consists of four, three-story buildings. Each building has twelve classrooms and seven offices. We would like to provide at least three large recycle bins on each floor, equipped with special recyclable-friendly bags. Likewise, we would like to provide every classroom with a smaller recycle bin and recycle bags. Teacher offices oftentimes have the greatest amount of paper waste. Thus, we would like to provide them with a large bin. In total, we intend to  set up around 57 large bins and around 36 small bins. <br><br>

          In addition to providing proper receptacles, we will have laminated flyers printed for each recycle bin to educate the student body and staff about what can and cannot be recycled. Towards the beginning of the school year, we will poll students on how much they know about recycling in our community, as well as the importance and their individual and family interest. We intend to repeat this survey towards the end of the school year to determine how perceptions have changed. To help students to get inspired about recycling, the EcoClub would like to help us host a competition where students create sculptures or artwork from school recyclables to demonstrate what can be recycled. <br><br>

          Our school is presently cleaned and serviced by Aramark. A partner teacher has spoken with the janitorial staff and was told that if a recycling dumpster was provided, the staff would be able to bring the recyclables to the proper dumpster for disposal. The company does this with other schools and offices around the city. <br><br>

          Finally, being in Baton Rouge affords our residents with several options to dispose of and recycle responsibly. We would like to promote the use of these agencies to our students and their families. Most of our residents use the option for curbside recycling pick-up every week. In addition to prompting students to take responsibility for recycling while at school, we hope to educate them on how to recycle at home if they do not already do so. In addition to curbside pick-up of recyclables, Baton Rouge also houses an organization that takes in and sells electronics – Capital Area Corporate Recycling Council – that students' families can go to to dispose of electronics. <br></p>

          <p><b>STATEMENT OF NEED</b><br><br>

          When planning this project, we contacted a few teachers who were already recycling in their classrooms, as well as the EcoClub at Lee. The teachers showed us the amount of recyclables that they collected in one week and it was substantial. The teachers assured us that their students had interest in recycling properly and that they have had success in their classrooms. We also checked trash cans around the school after lunch and found a substantial amount of recyclable materials, such as the plastic bags and containers that the vending machine lunch comes in and empty snack bags from students' lunches.<br><br>

          The population of 773 at our school is 28% white, 64.5% black, and 7.5% Asian. Additionally, 57% of our students receive free or reduced lunch. Next year, our population should reach around 1200 students. Our school is a magnet school and is made up of community students in East Baton Rouge parish. Being a public school, however, we are not afforded with additional money to implement this type of initiative on our own, which is why we turned to grant opportunities like Keep Louisiana Beautiful. With the grant, we are now able to serve our school and community by starting and maintaining this recycling program.<br></p>
